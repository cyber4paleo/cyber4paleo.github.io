# Team Members

  * Douglas Fils  -- Consortium for Ocean Leadership


# Project Goal

To take the resources from [https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/GeologicTime] 
and use them to add properties to geologic time resources, like data files across
several group.   Simon Cox has noted that if we can get interest in these he
would spend some time to update the latest ICS timescales and also 
OWL time [http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19108/2002/temporal]

# A Few Resources on timescales
